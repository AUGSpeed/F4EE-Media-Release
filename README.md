## What this modlist does:

Your game will be much less recognizable and very tough, especially at early levels; you have been warned. Along with being more difficult, this modlist makes Fallout 4 look better, play better, adds new guns, new ways to build settlements, new strategies and ways to roleplay your character. It even adds new content to explore all over the map. New NPCs, new quests, new adventures, and new enemies to fight, all fitting into the world and making it that much more enjoyable. Fallout 4 always seemed a little empty, so now you have more things to play around with to fill the world yourself, as well as new things that already fill some of the empty void! Roleplay to your heart's content, or find a way to become the strongest being in the Commonwealth; it's all up to you! Oh, and the annoying voice of the main character is gone, so you can sound like yourself for once! You are not shoehorned into being whoever the game tells you to. You are you. Play this game how YOU want to, not like how Bethesda wants you to.

If you are reading this, either you stalk my GitHub, or I have given you a media release copy of Fallout 4: Enhanced Edition. THe media release copy is very special, so I hope you enjoy it! The main improvements here are the fact that the workbase steps are now automated, and I have added quite a few quest mods and patched them for Horizon 1.8, as well as adding a fun new armor crafting system!

### This modlist will:

* Make the game harder.
* Create an environment more conducive to roleplaying.
* Add more content to the game.
* Make veterans of the game go: "Wait, this is still Fallout 4?"
* Make your game look great with minimal performance impact.
* Add more guns and equipment to the game world.

### This modlist will NOT:

* Get you a girlfriend/boyfriend.
* Cure cancer.

## Requirements:

* All Fallout 4 DLCs (Except for the HD DLC) - No, this is not negotiable
* A CLEAN Fallout 4 Installation - meaning without any previous mods in any way.
* About 100 GB of free disk space on top of your Fallout installation, so about 130 GBs total (this will go down after installation is finished, but this much is required during the install process).

## Installing with Wabbajack:

### Step 0:

Run Fallout 4 once from Steam. You can close the launcher when it detects your video settings. After this, create a new folder named 'F4EE' anywhere outside of Program Files. Then, download [Wabbajack](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases) and select Install From Disk and select the F4EE file you just downloaded, and install it to the folder you just made.

### Step 1:

After it finishes, go to your install folder, and open up the `Game Folder Files` folder and Copy these all into your Fallout 4 Directory.

### Step 2:

Download the latest ENB binaries from [the ENB website](http://enbdev.com/download_mod_fallout4.htm). Open the archive you downloaded, and go into the `WrapperVersion` folder. Extract ONLY the two files `d3d11.dll` and `d3dcompiler_46e.dll` into your Fallout 4 Directory.

### Step 6:

Launch MO2 from the exe found in your install folder.

### Step 7:

In the top right of MO2, use the drop down menu to select `FO4Config`, and hit the `Run` button to the right of that. When opened, direct it to your `Fallout4.exe` location. DO NOT replace the Fallout4Launcher if prompted. After this is done, follow these instructions for each of the tabs:

* Tweaks: 
Activate `Always Active`, `Invalidate Archives` and `Fix Sensitivity Ratio`.
* Performance:
Next to `iNumHWThreads`, put the number of cores that your CPU has. Next to `Dir Distance`, put 3000. Disable `Radial Blur`. For performance over beauty, put the field next to `Resolution` to 2048.
* Camera:
Feel free to edit your field of view as much as you like here.
* Textures/Decals:
Click the `Recommended` button, and set `Max Actor Decals` to 40.
* UI:
Simply change the colors to your liking.
* Gameplay:
Set `Difficulty` to 5, enable `Dialogue Subtitles`, and feel free to disable `Show Tutorials` if you already know everything.
* Final Step:
Now, hit 'Save' in the bottom left.

### Step 9:

After creating your character, you should configure the MCM menus found at the top of your pause menu. Follow [these pictures](https://imgur.com/a/sTVhaFd) and you will be good! After getting the Pipboy, make sure to load both the True Storms Config and Beantown Interiors holotapes, then follow the final images in the link above to finish your config!

You're done! Have fun, and feel free to join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/g4r3pcP) or the Wabbajack Discord server to see what I am working on next or if you have suggestions or anything! I will also be doing my best to support users on this Nexus page, so you can contact me there too! I hope you enjoy your experience!
